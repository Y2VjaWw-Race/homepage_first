        <p>In <a href = "https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vapid">vapid</a> listlessness I leant my head against the window, and continued spelling over Catherine Earnshaw -
    Heathcliff - Linton, till my eyes closed; but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters
    started from the dark, as vivid as spectres - the air swarmed with Catherines; and rousing myself to dispel the
    obtrusive name, I discovered my candle-wick reclining on one of the antique volumes, and perfuming the
    place with an odour of roasted calf-skin. I snuffed it off, and, very ill at ease under the influence of cold and
    lingering nausea, sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee. It was a Testament, in lean type, and
    smelling dreadfully musty: a fly-leaf bore the inscription - <br>'Catherine Earnshaw, her book,' and a date some
    quarter of a century back. I shut it, and took up another and another, till I had examined all. Catherine's library
    was select, and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used, though not altogether for a legitimate
    purpose: scarcely one chapter had escaped, a pen-and-ink commentary - at least the appearance of one -
    covering every morsel of blank that the printer had left. Some were detached sentences; other parts took the
    form of a regular diary, scrawled in an unformed, childish hand. At the top of an extra page (quite a treasure,
    probably, when first lighted on) I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend Joseph, -
    rudely, yet powerfully sketched. An immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine, and I
    began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics</p>
